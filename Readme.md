ResumeWorkshop

## Project Description
ResumeWorkshop is a decentralized application (dApp) that enables users to host and participate in workshops. Hosts can create workshops by providing relevant details, set participant limits, and charge for participation. Participants can register for workshops, and attendance can be marked by the host. This ensures a transparent, automated process for managing workshops on the blockchain.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to provide a blockchain-based solution for managing workshops that eliminates middlemen, ensures transparency, and facilitates secure transactions between hosts and participants. By leveraging the Ethereum blockchain, we aim to create a platform that fosters a community of learning and skill development while ensuring fairness and trust.

## Key Features
- **Workshop Creation**: Hosts can create workshops with customized details such as name, description, price, start time, and participant limit.
- **Participant Registration**: Users can register for workshops by paying the specified fee before the registration deadline.
- **Attendance Tracking**: Hosts can mark attendance for registered participants.
- **Secure Payments**: Payments are held securely in the contract and released to the host upon workshop finalization.
- **Event Transparency**: All workshop details and participant information are stored on the blockchain, ensuring immutability and transparency.


## Future Enhancements
- Add the ability to issue NFTs as certificates for attendance.
- Implement a feedback mechanism for workshops.
- Integrate with off-chain data storage for detailed workshop content.
- Enable workshop discovery using tags and search functionality.
